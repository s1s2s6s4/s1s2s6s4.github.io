I want to weave my mind into a canvas and lay it in front of you -<br>
Stark light, space between airborne particulates;<br>
The sky like a glass dome;<br>
Smooth cheeks, sweaty arms, soft hands in mine;<br>
Throbbing anger, anguished blitheness;<br>
Strutting around like fish in water, then<br>
Words fell apart in my ears, clothes chafe on a thousand points;<br>
Mind torn apart by a longing - <br>
Constantly seeking,<br>
Always blind<br>
<br>
Instead, I only have threads - <br>
Fraying, dangling at daydream’s edge;<br>
I’m sending you some stamps instead<br>
